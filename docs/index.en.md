## **Introduction**
    
Welcome to the **Core** documentation.

**Core** is a library for developing RESTful APIs in **Node.js**.

???+ warning "Attention"
    
    **Core** is currently under development and is subject to frequent changes.  


The documentation and features will continue to evolve as the project progresses.

The development of **Core** is progressing gradually, as I am working on several projects simultaneously.  
I appreciate your understanding and patience.

For now, **Core** is recommended only for experimental or non-critical projects.

Feel free to contact me for any questions, suggestions, or to report a bug.
